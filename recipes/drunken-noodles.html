    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chef John did have a drink or three while making these drunken noodles, so he could enjoy them as the food gods intended, which is slightly drunk.
      At least that's the main theory on how this "Pad Kee Mao" dish got its name. It is one of the easiest, and most delicious noodle recipe Chef John know.
    </p>
    <p>Serve garnished with Thai Basil.</p>
